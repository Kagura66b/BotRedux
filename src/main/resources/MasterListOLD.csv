The bag weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains. If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground  they explode in a 10-­‐‑foot radius  extending from the beans. Each creature in the area  including you  must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw  taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save  or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. If you remove a bean from the bag  plant it in dirt or sand  and then water it  the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table  determine it randomly  or create an effect.\nd100        Effect\n01        5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a\ntoadstool  roll any die. On an odd roll  the\neater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution\nsaving throw or take 5d6 poison damage and\nbecome poisoned for 1 hour. On an even roll\nthe eater gains 5d6 temporary hit points for\n1 hour.\n02-10        A geyser erupts and spouts water  beer\nberry juice  tea  vinegar  wine  or oil (GMa445s\nchoice) 30 feet into the air for 1d12 rounds.\n11-20        A treant sprouts. Therea445s a 50 percent\nchance that the treant is chaotic evil and\nattacks.\n21-30        An animate  immobile stone statue in your\nlikeness rises. It makes verbal threats\nagainst you. If you leave it and others come\nnear  it describes you as the most heinous\nof villains and directs the newcomers to\nfind and attack you. If you are on the same\nplane of existence as the statue  it knows\nwhere you are. The statue becomes\ninanimate after 24 hours.\n31-40        A campfire with blue flames springs forth\nand burns for 24 hours (or until it is\nextinguished).\n41-50        1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout.\n51-60        1d4 + 8 bright pink toads crawl forth.\nWhenever a toad is touched  it transforms\ninto a Large or smaller monster of the GMa445s\nchoice. The monster remains for 1 minute\nthen disappears in a puff of bright pink\nsmoke.\n61-70        A hungry bulette burrows up and attacks.\n71-80        A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit\n1d8 of which act as randomly determined\nmagic potions  while one acts as an\ningested poison of the GMa445s choice. The\ntree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit\nremains  retaining any magic for 30 days.\n81-90        A nest of 1d4 + 3 eggs springs up. Any\ncreature that eats an egg must make a DC\n20 Constitution saving throw. On a\nsuccessful save  a creature permanently\nincreases its lowest ability score by 1\nrandomly choosing among equally low\nscores. On a failed save  the creature takes\n10d6 force damage from an internal magical\nexplosion.\n91-99        A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts\nupward.
